# Supervisor
**System for Controlling Process State.**
- Supervisor is a system for controlling and maintaining process state, similar to what init does, but not intended as an init replacement.
- It will manage individual processes or groups of processes that need to be started and stopped in order, and it is possible to control individual process state via an rpc mechanism, thus allowing ordinary users to restart processes.

## Running Supervisor
- To run `supervisord` and `supervisorctl`, you need to know your Python installation's `BINDIR` (binary directory). For example, if Python is installed with `--prefix=/usr/local/py`, the `BINDIR` would be `/usr/local/py/bin`. Check the output of `setup.py install` if you're unsure of your `BINDIR`.

- **Adding a Program**
  - To use `supervisord`, you must add at least one program to its configuration file `supervisord.conf`. A program section defines a command that `supervisord` will manage.
  - For example, to run the UNIX `cat` command, add this to `supervisord.conf`:  
```ini
[program:foo]
command=/bin/cat
```  
- This is the simplest configuration, but there are many other options available for program sections.

### Running supervisord
- To start **supervisord**, run `$BINDIR/supervisord`. It runs in the background by default and logs to `$CWD/supervisor.log`. Use the `-n` flag to run it in the foreground for debugging.
- **Warning**: Supervisord looks for its config file in default locations, including the current directory. To avoid security risks, use the `-c` flag to specify an absolute path to the config file, especially when running as root.
- To update the programs managed by supervisord, edit `supervisord.conf` and restart supervisord (e.g., `kill -HUP`). Command-line options override settings in the config file.

### Example Scenarios:
1. **Running with a Custom Configuration File**:
   - Command: `supervisord -c /etc/my_supervisord.conf`
   - Explanation: This starts supervisord using a custom configuration file located at `/etc/my_supervisord.conf`.

2. **Running in Foreground with Debug Logging**:
   - Command: `supervisord -n -e debug`
   - Explanation: This runs supervisord in the foreground with debug-level logging for troubleshooting.

3. **Setting Log File Rotation**:
   - Command: `supervisord -l /var/log/supervisord.log -y 10MB -z 3`
   - Explanation: This sets the log file to rotate when it reaches 10MB, keeping 3 backup copies.

4. **Running as a Specific User**:
   - Command: `supervisord -u myuser`
   - Explanation: This starts supervisord as the user `myuser`.

5. **Preventing Log Cleanup**:
   - Command: `supervisord -k`
   - Explanation: This prevents supervisord from cleaning up old AUTO process log files at startup.

### Running supervisorctl
- To use **supervisorctl**, run `$BINDIR/supervisorctl`. This opens a shell to control processes managed by **supervisord**. Type `help` for a list of commands.
- You can also run one-time commands directly, like `supervisorctl stop all`. If arguments are provided, it skips the interactive shell, executes the command, and exits with `0` for success or a non-zero code for errors. For example, `supervisorctl status all` returns non-zero if any process isn’t running.
- If **supervisord** requires authentication, you’ll be prompted for credentials in interactive mode.
  
**supervisorctl Command-Line Options**
- Control Applications run by supervisord from the cmd line.
```sh
root@ip-172-31-12-132:/etc/supervisor/conf.d# supervisorctl -h
supervisorctl -- control applications run by supervisord from the cmd line.

Usage: /usr/bin/supervisorctl [options] [action [arguments]]

Options:

-c/--configuration FILENAME -- configuration file path (searches if not given)
-h/--help -- print usage message and exit
-i/--interactive -- start an interactive shell after executing commands
-s/--serverurl URL -- URL on which supervisord server is listening
     (default "http://localhost:9001").
-u/--username USERNAME -- username to use for authentication with server
-p/--password PASSWORD -- password to use for authentication with server
-r/--history-file -- keep a readline history (if readline is available)

action [arguments] -- see below
```
- Actions are commands like "tail" or "stop".  If -i is specified or no action is specified on the command line, a "shell" interpreting actions typed interactively is started.  Use the action "help" to find out about available actions.

## Understanding Signals and Signal Handlers in Supervisord
Supervisord is a process control system that allows you to manage and monitor multiple processes. It can respond to various **signals** sent to it, which trigger specific actions. These signals are a way to communicate with the `supervisord` process to perform tasks like shutting down, reloading configurations, or reopening log files.

### How to Send Signals to Supervisord
- To send a signal to `supervisord`, you need its **process ID (PID)**. This PID is stored in a file, typically located at `$CWD/supervisord.pid` (unless you've configured a different path in the `[supervisord]` section of the configuration file).
- You can send a signal using the `kill` command in Unix-like systems:

```bash
kill -<SIGNAL> <PID>
```
- `<SIGNAL>`: The signal you want to send (e.g., `SIGTERM`, `SIGHUP`, etc.).
- `<PID>`: The process ID of `supervisord`.

### Signal Handlers in Supervisord

Here’s a breakdown of the signals and their effects on `supervisord`:

#### 1. **SIGTERM**
- **Action**: Gracefully shuts down `supervisord` and all its subprocesses.
- **Timeframe**: This may take several seconds as it ensures all processes are properly terminated.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGTERM $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
  ```

#### 2. **SIGINT**
- **Action**: Similar to `SIGTERM`, it gracefully shuts down `supervisord` and all its subprocesses.
- **Timeframe**: This may also take several seconds.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGINT $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
  ```

#### 3. **SIGQUIT**
- **Action**: Gracefully shuts down `supervisord` and all its subprocesses.
- **Timeframe**: This may take several seconds.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGQUIT $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
  ```

#### 4. **SIGHUP**
- **Action**: 
  - Stops all processes managed by `supervisord`.
  - Reloads the configuration from the first config file it finds.
  - Restarts all processes based on the new configuration.
- **Use Case**: Useful when you’ve made changes to the configuration file and want to apply them without fully restarting `supervisord`.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGHUP $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
  ```

#### 5. **SIGUSR2**
- **Action**: Closes and reopens the main activity log and all child log files.
- **Use Case**: Useful for log rotation, where you want `supervisord` to start writing to new log files without interrupting the processes.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  kill -SIGUSR2 $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
  ```
---

### Practical Example: Reloading Configuration

Suppose you’ve updated your `supervisord.conf` file and want to apply the changes without restarting `supervisord`. You can use the `SIGHUP` signal:

1. Update your configuration file (`supervisord.conf`).
2. Send the `SIGHUP` signal:
   ```bash
   kill -SIGHUP $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
   ```
3. `supervisord` will reload the configuration and restart all processes accordingly.

---
### Practical Example: Log Rotation

If you’re rotating logs and want `supervisord` to start writing to new log files, use the `SIGUSR2` signal:

1. Rotate the logs (e.g., using `logrotate`).
2. Send the `SIGUSR2` signal:
   ```bash
   kill -SIGUSR2 $(cat /path/to/supervisord.pid)
   ```
3. `supervisord` will close the current log files and reopen them, ensuring logs are written to the new files.

## 4. Managing Nginx with Supervisor

### Install Nginx
Install Nginx using the following command:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### Stop and Disable Nginx Service
Since Supervisor will manage Nginx, stop and disable the default Nginx service:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl disable nginx
```

### Create a Supervisor Configuration for Nginx
Create a new configuration file for Nginx in the Supervisor configuration directory:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/nginx.conf
```

Add the following configuration to the file:
```ini
[program:nginx]
command=/usr/sbin/nginx -c /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
autostart=true
autorestart=true
startretries=5
numprocs=1
startsecs=0
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
stderr_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/%(program_name)s_stderr.log
stderr_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
stdout_logfile=/var/log/supervisor/%(program_name)s_stdout.log
stdout_logfile_maxbytes=10MB
```
- **command**: Specifies the command to start Nginx.
- **autostart**: Ensures Nginx starts automatically with Supervisor.
- **autorestart**: Automatically restarts Nginx if it fails.
- **stderr_logfile** and **stdout_logfile**: Define log files for error and output logs.

### Apply Nginx Configuration
Reload Supervisor to apply the new Nginx configuration:
```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
```

### Manage Nginx via Supervisor
Use the `supervisorctl` command to manage Nginx:
```bash
sudo supervisorctl
```
- Stop Nginx:
  ```bash
  stop nginx:nginx_00
  ```
- Start Nginx:
  ```bash
  start nginx:nginx_00
  ```
- Exit the Supervisor control interface:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```

---

## 5. Verification and Testing
### Verify Nginx Processes
Check if Nginx is running under Supervisor:
```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```
### Access the Supervisor Web Interface
Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-server-ip>:9001`. Use the credentials (`admin/admin`) to log in and view the status of managed processes.
---
## 6. Troubleshooting
### Check Supervisor Logs
If issues arise, check the Supervisor logs for errors:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/supervisor/supervisord.log
```
### Check Nginx Logs
Review Nginx logs for any errors:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
```
### Verify Configuration Files
Ensure there are no syntax errors in the configuration files:
```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread
sudo supervisorctl update
```
---
## Configuration File
The Supervisor configuration file is conventionally named `supervisord.conf`. It is used by both supervisord and supervisorctl. If either application is started without the `-c` option (the option which is used to tell the application the configuration filename explicitly), the application will look for a file named `supervisord.conf` within the following locations, in the specified order. It will use the first file it finds.
### File Format
`supervisord.conf` is a Windows-INI-style (Python ConfigParser) file. It has sections (each denoted by a `[header]`) and key / value pairs within the sections. The sections and their allowable values are described below.
### Environment Variables
- Environment variables that are present in the environment at the time that supervisord is started can be used in the configuration file using the Python string expression syntax `%(ENV_X)s`:
```ini
[program:example]
command=/usr/bin/example --loglevel=%(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s
```
- In the example above, the expression %(ENV_LOGLEVEL)s would be expanded to the value of the environment variable LOGLEVEL. In Supervisor 3.2 and later, %(ENV_X)s expressions are supported in all options.

### **Key Takeaways**  
1. **Supervisor Configuration is Modular** – Each section serves a specific function.  
2. **Authentication** – Secure with username/password for HTTP servers and `supervisorctl`.  
3. **Process Management** – `program`, `group`, `fcgi-program`, and `eventlistener` control different process types.  
4. **Logging & Debugging** – Logs are configurable for debugging (`stdout_logfile`, `stderr_logfile`).  
5. **Extensibility** – Custom RPC interfaces allow for advanced automation and integration.  

This table makes it **easy to understand and use** Supervisor's configuration effectively. Let me know if you need any improvements! 🚀

stderr_logfile = /a/path   ## Path to the standard error log file.  
stderr_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB   ## Maximum size before rotating stderr log file.  
stderr_logfile_backups = 10   ## Number of rotated stderr log backups to keep.  
stderr_events_enabled = false   ## Enables event monitoring for stderr logs.  

environment = A="1",B="2"   ## Sets environment variables for the process.  
serverurl = AUTO   ## Defines the server URL (AUTO uses default settings).  
```
- Key Benefits:
  - Allows multiple FastCGI processes to share a socket for improved performance.  
  - Enables graceful restarts since the socket remains open while child processes restart.  
  - Works with any web server, providing full process management without server dependency.

### [eventlistener:x]  
- This section configures event listener processes that handle Supervisor event notifications.  - Similar to `[program:x]`, but listens for specific Supervisor events.  

```ini
[eventlistener:theeventlistenername]  
command = /bin/eventlistener   ## Specifies the command to run the event listener.  
process_name = %(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d   ## Names each process uniquely.  
numprocs = 5   ## Defines the number of listener processes to spawn.  
events = PROCESS_STATE   ## Specifies the event types this listener will handle.  
buffer_size = 10   ## Defines the event queue size before messages are dropped.  
directory = /tmp   ## Sets the working directory for the process.  
umask = 022   ## Defines the file permission mask for new files.  
priority = -1   ## Determines the process start order (lower values start first).  
autostart = true   ## Starts the process automatically when `supervisord` starts.  
autorestart = unexpected   ## Restarts the process if it exits unexpectedly.  
startsecs = 1   ## Waits this many seconds before considering the process started.  
startretries = 3   ## Number of restart attempts if the process fails to start.  
exitcodes = 0   ## Specifies which exit codes are considered successful.  
stopsignal = QUIT   ## Signal sent to stop the process (e.g., TERM, KILL).  
stopwaitsecs = 10   ## Time to wait before forcefully stopping the process.  
stopasgroup = false   ## If true, sends stop signal to the entire process group.  
killasgroup = false   ## If true, kills the entire process group on termination.  
user = chrism   ## Runs the process as the specified user.  

redirect_stderr = false   ## If true, redirects stderr to stdout.  
stdout_logfile = /a/path   ## Path to the standard output log file.  
stdout_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB   ## Maximum size before rotating stdout log file.  
stdout_logfile_backups = 10   ## Number of rotated stdout log backups to keep.  
stdout_events_enabled = false   ## Enables event monitoring for stdout logs.  

stderr_logfile = /a/path   ## Path to the standard error log file.  
stderr_logfile_maxbytes = 1MB   ## Maximum size before rotating stderr log file.  
stderr_logfile_backups = 10   ## Number of rotated stderr log backups to keep.  
stderr_events_enabled = false   ## Enables event monitoring for stderr logs.  

environment = A="1",B="2"   ## Sets environment variables for the process.  
serverurl = AUTO   ## Defines the server URL (AUTO uses default settings).  
```
- Key Benefits:
  - Listens for Supervisor events (e.g., process state changes).  
  - Helps automate tasks like logging, monitoring, and alerting.  
  - Supports multiple event listeners running in parallel.

### [rpcinterface:x]  
- This section is used to extend Supervisor with custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interfaces.  
- It allows adding new functionalities beyond Supervisor’s default capabilities.  
```ini
[rpcinterface:supervisor]  
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = supervisor.rpcinterface:make_main_rpcinterface   ## Required for Supervisor’s standard RPC functions.  
```
- The above section **must be present** in the configuration for Supervisor to function properly.  
- If no additional RPC features are needed, no further modifications are required.  

- **Adding Custom RPC Interfaces**  
  - To customize Supervisor, additional `[rpcinterface:x]` sections can be added, where `x` is the custom namespace.  
```ini
[rpcinterface:another]  
supervisor.rpcinterface_factory = my.package:make_another_rpcinterface   ## Specifies a custom RPC factory function.  
retries = 1   ## Custom parameter passed to the factory function.  
```
- **Example Python Factory Function (`my.package` module)**
```python
from my.package.rpcinterface import AnotherRPCInterface

def make_another_rpcinterface(supervisord, **config):
    retries = int(config.get('retries', 0))  # Gets retries from the config
    return AnotherRPCInterface(supervisord, retries)  # Returns an instance of the custom interface
```
- Key Benefits:
  - Allows Supervisor to support additional RPC commands.  
  - Enables automation and integration with external systems.  
  - Custom parameters (like `retries`) can be defined in the config file and passed dynamically.
